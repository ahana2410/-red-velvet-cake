Heat oven to 350Â°F . Lightly grease one 16-inch cake pan with butter or nonstick oil spray and lightly dust with 1 tablespoon of the sifted cocoa powder.
Cream butter and sugar together until light in colour. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition to combine well.
In a smaller bowl, mix together oil, remaining cocoa powder, red food colouring and vanilla until smooth. Stir colour mixture and vinegar through the creamed sugar mixture to combine.
Sift together flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl. Add half of the dry ingredients and half of the buttermilk to the wet ingredients; mix well. Repeat with remaining dry ingredients and buttermilk. 
 bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack completely.
Transfer the cake onto a serving dish/plate, flat-side down.
